# discord-nuker-v12
A nuke discord bot that I installed before which works with Discord.js v12.
### How to install it ?
Install the files with git.
```git clone https://github.com/kzyweb/discord-nuker-v12.git```
Although discord.js has reached its 16th version, you can still try this program by installing version 12 of Discord.js with ```npm i discord.js@12```
### How to configure it?
Very simple, enter the token of your discord bot in the ```/json/config.js``` file, put your personalized message with ```"SendMessages": "YOUR MESSAGE"```
